# Zorkduino Shield

Eagle schematics and PCB for a Shield compatible with Arduino UNO. It features:

* PS/2 keyboard connector
* USB-A female, alternative mount for USB keyboards that can revert to PS/2 mode
* SD Card Connector
* Micro SD (alternative mount) Card Connector
* Dual RCA connector for Audio/Video
* P2 Stereo Jack (alternative mount) for Audio/Video 
* Infrared Receiver
* Reset Button

The connectors were disposed so all the wired connections are on the same side while the SD 
socket and the Infrared receiver are on the opposite side. This should make the device more
easy to be used and hence easier to put in a box.

The board was manually routed.
